<p>When Jo opened the door to the shed, she was covered in blood. Clara had trouble prying the axe from her hands. Jo said something about a pile of hiking stuff outside before collapsing.</p>
<p>“Jo! Jo!”</p>
<p>She didn’t respond, but Clara could see the slow rise and fall of Jo’s chest. She was sleeping, or more likely, in shock. Clara didn’t know how to deal with shock except to cover the person up. She threw the sleeping bag over Jo.</p>
<p>At least that terrible shrieking had stopped. Clara listened as hard as she could and could hear no more footsteps outside. </p>
<p>She pulled out her phone. The battery was dead.</p>
<p>They could stay inside the shack all spring and summer if they didn’t mind subsisting on maple syrup – could human beings survive on a diet of pure syrup? – but if they wanted any quality of life at all, they would have to get to the receiving hall. There, they could recharge their phones, wash the infected blood off Jo, and find some real food.</p>
<p>There was no clock in the sugar shack. Clara watched Jo sleep and tried to judge how much time had passed by the light that sifted in through the high window. She hadn’t seen a zombie yet. She did not think she wanted to.</p>
<p>While Jo had been in motion since the first moments of the crisis, Clara had watched it unfold from the isolation of the sugar shack. She showed up for her shift early, collecting maple water from the tappers and setting them to boil as the sun rose. She’d spent a sleepless night in an empty bed after her girlfriend, Kelly, informed her that she had been sleeping with someone else – several someone elses – and thought she might have a sex addiction. Clara laughed out loud at the suggestion. She threw Kelly out of their apartment, tossing clothing and toiletries down the stairs after her.</p>
<p>When Clara hefted the first bucket of maple water to her shoulder, her phone buzzed. It continued buzzing incessantly as Kelly called, texted, messaged, snapped and FaceTimed without pause. Out of sheer annoyance, Clara eventually answered and embarked on a long, pointless argument about whether sex addiction was a real disorder or just an excuse for sleeping around with a bunch of hippies and ravers. </p>
<p>An hour into Kelly’s long-winded explanation of why she’d gone to bed with her third illicit lover, Clara screamed at her to stop talking and was surprised to hear silence on the other end of the phone. Kelly never shut up, especially when someone told her to.</p>
<p>“Kelly?” Clara asked. “Is the connection-”</p>
<p>Kelly screamed. </p>
<p>Clara heard ripping noises, followed by a loud bang. Kelly started crying.</p>
<p>“It bit me,” she choked out. </p>
<p>“What bit you?”</p>
<p>“Too much blood,” Kelly whimpered and fell silent. </p>
<p>Clara dialed 911. </p>
<p>The line was busy. While she was on hold, an automated message played.</p>
<p>“A state of emergency has been declared. Your call may not be answered. Boil your drinking water, and-”</p>
<p>Clara hung up and checked Facebook. Her news feed was full of shaky photos of what looked like dead people roaming the streets. All the photos were taken from above. From what most of Clara’s still living friends were saying, only people on the top levels of their apartment buildings had managed to escape the first wave.</p>
<p>Kelly had been staying at a friend’s place, a basement apartment in the heart of downtown. She hadn’t stood a chance. </p>
<p>Clara’s phone started buzzing again – her parents, a hundred miles away, checking if she was alive. She assured them that she would try to get out of the city as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Then she received an alert from the university. Every major metropolitan area in North America was under quarantine until further notice.</p>
<p>The zombies were downtown. They hadn’t reached the farms and the suburbs yet, but despite what she was telling her parents, Clara knew she couldn’t make it past the quarantine line. The text message from Student Services said that anyone who broke quarantine would be shot.</p>
<p>No one else showed up to work that day. Since there was nothing else to do, Clara went about her job as usual. She didn’t even bother to watch for zombies.</p>
<p>She didn’t want to think about them.</p>
<p>Her parents called every fifteen minutes. Clara held the phone between her ear and shoulder as she collected buckets of maple water from the tappers and dumped them into hot pans to boil off. When she was on her fifth bucket of the morning, her battery went dead.</p>
<p>That was when she decided to stay inside the sugar shack with the door locked.</p>
<p>Until Jo arrived. </p>
<p>Clara glanced at the unconscious, gore-spattered Jo and wondered how she would move her. Jo wasn’t as fat as Clara, but she wasn’t exactly small. Clara didn’t know what she’d do if more zombies showed up while she was dragging Jo across the muddy hundred-odd meters to the receiving hall.</p>
<p>She tried shaking Jo, and even pinched her upper arm, but that just made Jo grumble and turn over.</p>
<p>“Come on,” she muttered. Secretly, Clara was relieved that they wouldn’t have to leave the safety of the sugar shack just yet.</p>
<p>She looked down at Jo and started laughing. Clara and Jo had never been close, mainly because Jo never got close to anyone. If someone had asked Clara who she’d team up with in a zombie apocalypse, Jo never would have crossed her mind. </p>
<p>Jo was just so opaque. She’d been in the same engineering program as Clara, but dropped out to become a pastry chef with no explanation to her professors and fellow classmates. Because Clara worked in the sugar shack, they’d kept in touch, but she and Jo didn’t go to the same parties or have friends in common. It was weirder than having a stranger in that little shack with her. A stranger wouldn’t be a living, breathing reminder of the old world.</p>
<p>The laughter woke Jo. She sat up, groggy, and Clara quickly disguised her hysterical giggling as a coughing fit. </p>
<p>“Oh, ew, I’m sorry.” Jo made a grimace of disgust and pulled her blood-tacky sweater away from her chest. “I got brains all over the sleeping bag.”</p>
<p>“It’s ok.”</p>
<p>“We can’t stay here,” Jo said.</p>
<p>“There’s the receiving hall.”</p>
<p>“Yeah?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know if it’ll be any better.”</p>
<p>Jo closed her eyes and pinched the bridge of her nose between her thumb and forefinger. “It has a root cellar. When the zombies from downtown come out here, we can hide there and wait for them to pass.”</p>
<p>“Will that work?”</p>
<p>“Do you have any better ideas?” Jo asked. If anyone else had said that, Clara would think they were being sarcastic. </p>
<p>“Fine.”</p>
<p>Jo pushed open the door and walked out without one look back. For her, it was easy. She’d been outside since the world ended. </p>
<p>Clara followed. She shielded her eyes against the weak, thin sun, listening for approaching zombie hordes and hearing only birdsong.</p>
<p>Consoling herself that if there were birds, there couldn’t be that many zombies, she helped Jo pick up the zombie hiker’s backpack. There was a shoe close to the backpack, but Clara didn’t look past it. She might see the leg and the body attached to it if she did.</p>
<p>They trudged up the path toward the receiving hall. Clara pulled out her keys and unlocked the front door. She and Jo slipped inside, Clara closing and locking the door behind them as soon as they were safely inside. </p>
<p>They were in the welcome center, where on a typical day, school groups and families on weekend trips would be sitting on the old, patched couches around a big fireplace while they waited for their tour guides. Clara had done time as the all-in-one ticket vendor, coat checker and greeter stationed in the kiosk on the far end of the room.</p>
<p>“These walls are all glass,” Jo said. “We can’t sleep here.”</p>
<p>“We’ll stay in the pantry.”</p>
<p>“Is there a radio?”</p>
<p>“Better, we have TV.”</p>
<p>“If we had a radio, we could talk to other people once the internet goes down.”</p>
<p>“I’ll look for one.”</p>
<p>Clara pawed through the supply closet until she found a dusty, ancient radio. She brought it back out to where Jo was standing, next to a rack of Maple Syrup: A Sweet History pamphlets.</p>
<p>“Got it!” </p>
<p>Jo didn’t respond. </p>
<p>Clara followed Jo’s gaze to the window, where the zombies Jo had dispatched earlier were drooling blood and thumping their gray hands against the glass.</p>
<p>“It’s impossible,” Clara breathed, watching an eyeless horror rattle its exposed finger bones.</p>
<p>Clara’s first sight of zombies didn’t render her an incoherent mess, which surprised Jo. From what little she knew of the other woman; Clara was the type to shriek at the sight of a dead mouse in a trap. </p>
<p>“It’s probably a different group of zombies,” Jo pointed out.</p>
<p>Clara shook her head and pointed to the hiking backpack. The zombie with the exposed finger bones was wearing a necklace with a gold name charm that dangled over its concave chest: Felicia. The same name was embroidered in curly yellow script on the pack’s top flap.</p>
<p>Plus, the pink-and-white canvas backpack was perfectly coordinated with the pink-and-white dyed faux leather boot on Felicia’s remaining foot. </p>
<p>“You must recognize them.”</p>
<p>“I don’t remember what they look like,” Jo said, peeved. “I killed them, and that should be enough.”</p>
<p>“We could burn them.”</p>
<p>“So they can run around the log cabin while on fire?”</p>
<p>Clara shook her head. “You’ll dismember them. We can burn them piece by piece, in the museum’s kiln. We had an exhibition on native pottery last week and haven’t dismantled it yet.”</p>
<p>“We can’t do that when all the zombies from the city swarm us.”</p>
<p>“You said we’d hide out in the root cellar then, remember?”</p>
<p>“Then we’ll hide in the root cellar now.”</p>
<p>“How will we harvest the syrup?”</p>
<p>Jo glared at Clara. “I’m not killing them again. Not alone.”</p>
<p>“But I-”</p>
<p>“If I can do it, so can you.”</p>
<p>Jo handed Clara the axe. She knelt beside the cold hearth of the entrance hall fireplace and dug around until she found an iron poker. </p>
<p>“I’ll use the poker, get them in the eye and chest. That at least stuns them. You get at many as you can with the axe, and cut them into pieces that will fit in the kiln.”</p>
<p>“But you’ll help? With the… chopping?”</p>
<p>Jo shook her head. “You need to learn how to do this kind of thing for yourself.”</p>
<p>Clara, who had never so much as chopped wood for kindling at her family’s yearly campout, hefted the axe awkwardly to her shoulder.</p>
<p>“Ready?” asked Jo.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Jo opened the door. The zombies stopped banging on the windows and shuffled slowly toward the open doorway, and Clara, who had suddenly forgotten how to move her limbs.</p>
<p>Other than Felicia, there was a gangly teenager in track pants and a bloodstained sweat shirt and an old lady with frizzy, blood-matted white hair. The old lady was the only one who still had two feet, so she reached Clara first. Clara winced and turned away.</p>
<p>“Don’t turn your back on her! Kill her!” Jo drove the iron poker through Felicia’s eye socket. </p>
<p>Clara took a step back. The old lady lunged, her dentures clacking shut inches from the tip of Clara’s nose.</p>
<p>“You’re on your own,” Jo said irritably, plunging the poker into the teenager’s throat. “Don’t think I’ll do this thing with someone who can’t kill to save her own life.”</p>
<p>Clara lifted the axe above her head and brought it down as hard as she could, cleaving the old lady’s skull in two. The zombie dropped to the floor.</p>
<p>“I did it!” she yelled, pumping her blood-spattered axe in the air. “Jo, I did it!”</p>
<p>“Good. Now chop.”</p>
<p>Clara gritted her teeth, raised the axe, dropped the axe, staggered to the welcome center kiosk and threw up.</p>
<p>Jo sighed, picking up the axe. “Go get the kiln started.”</p>
<p>Clara wiped her mouth, nodded, and unhooked the latch on the gate of the kiosk. She unlocked the door that led to the office and museum, trying desperately to hold back the tide of bile rising in her throat. She was successful until she reached the first glass case of native pottery, which she proceeded to decorate with what looked like bits of her stomach lining.</p>
<p>Later, as she and Jo fed pieces of dismembered zombie into the kiln, she asked:</p>
<p>“Would you really have let the zombie get me?”</p>
<p>Jo smiled. It was the first Clara had ever seen her smile, even before the world ended.</p>
<p>“We’re in this together,” she said. “I would never let any harm come to you.”</p>
<p>“But you-”</p>
<p>“I’m not going to be with you every second. You’re soft. You need to toughen up. But I’m not going to leave you to die.”</p>
<p>Clara wanted to ask Jo exactly how, given that they’d both grown up in the suburbs and attended the same university and lived in the same city, Jo had ended up tough while Clara hadn’t. But she just picked up another finger and fed it into the fire. She didn’t want to spoil Jo’s good mood.</p>
