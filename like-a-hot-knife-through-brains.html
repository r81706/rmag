<p>It was easy to forget Jo’s original purpose in coming to the sugar shack. They had achieved her goal of refining enough maple syrup to set them up as key players in the post-apocalypse economy. The problem was, no live people were emerging from the forest or the deserted neighborhoods off the green belt trail. Except for her occasional excursions to the surrounding suburbs, which grew less and less fruitful as summer turned into fall, Jo sometimes forgot anyone existed other than Clara and herself. </p>
<p>They rarely spoke, Clara tending the garden, Jo patrolling in wider and wider circles. More zombies were reaching the sugar shack, but dispatching them now was so commonplace that Jo usually didn’t bother to mention her encounters to Clara. Instead, she began a sourdough culture with some of the flour she’d scrounged from the abandoned mill nearby, and spent each evening folding, developing and kneading dough, baking fresh rounds of country sourdough each morning. </p>
<p>“Is this a coping mechanism?” Clara asked one day, poking her head into the kitchen. She wiped her sweaty forehead, which only served to smear it with more dirt. To her had fallen the task of planting and tending to the seeds Jo had discovered in that garden. Jo did not speak of the garden, except to mention – once, under the influence of a quarter bottle of scotch she’d looted – that it was “creepy.” From someone who killed and burned zombies daily, Clara figured that this was an understatement.</p>
<p>“Hello?” Clara called again. “Earth to Jo? Are you freaking out about something?”</p>
<p>“I guess,” Jo answered, but offered no additional explanation of her nocturnal baking habits. Even the idea of telling Clara about the zombies she’d hacked apart that day made her temples throb and her mouth turn dry.</p>
<p>The electricity stayed on, but the cable went out. It was followed shortly after by the complete loss of cell service. </p>
<p>Finally, the internet went down.</p>
<p>This posed a serious setback to Jo and Clara’s maple syrup distribution plan. Clara had started a Facebook group cheekily titled “Market of Doom” where Sanjay’s supermarket and other isolated groups of refugees could inventory their combined supplies and work out proposed trades. Jo was setting herself up to be the vehicle for trading. She, Sanjay, and a lady named Frances who lived on a farm closer to the city had worked out the densest concentrations of zombies near their respective locations and had worked out a bike route that would allow Jo to skirt the hordes and deliver the goods.</p>
<p>Two days before Jo’s proposed journey, Clara turned on her laptop to find that there was no Wi-fi signal. It usually came back in an hour, so she read for a while, ate a hunk of Jo’s bread with a can of baked beans and tidied up the stacks of maple syrup cans. </p>
<p>The Wi-fi didn’t come back after that. Or the next hour after, or the hour after that, even when Clara unplugged the router and plugged it back in again.</p>
<p>She sat on the couch and cried until Jo came back from her evening patrol. </p>
<p>“Internet’s gone,” Clara choked out. “I’m sorry, there was nothing I could do.”</p>
<p>Jo just nodded and went into the kitchen to bake more bread.</p>
<p>“We can’t eat all that!” Clara yelled.</p>
<p>“Freezing it!” Jo shot back.</p>
<p>Clara sighed and went back to reading a tattered paperback she’d found in the old kiosk.</p>
<p>A loud clang sounded from the kitchen. Jo stormed into the welcome center, eyes wild.</p>
<p>“Did you throw out my starter?” she demanded.</p>
<p>“Your what?”</p>
<p>“My sourdough starter. In the glass jar on the countertop.”</p>
<p>“I haven’t been in the kitchen.”</p>
<p>“Where the hell could it be?”</p>
<p>Clara threw her hands up helplessly.</p>
<p>Jo gave her a dark look. “I’m going for a walk.”</p>
<p>Clara opened her mouth to point out the danger of walking outside after sunset, when you couldn’t see the zombies coming, but Jo was already out the door.</p>
<p>She hadn’t gone far when she heard slow, clumsy footsteps in the underbrush. Her hand went to her belt. </p>
<p>The iron poker was back in the kitchen.</p>
<p>She couldn’t risk leading the zombie back to the house, to Clara, where its moaning would alert any other undead wandering in the forest to the presence of two tasty human snacks. She knelt and picked up a rock.</p>
<p>“Over here, zombie!” she called, raising the rock above her head.</p>
<p>It staggered out of the bushes, weaving crazily, then collapsed at her feet.</p>
<p>She almost brought the rock down before she realized that the zombie had made no attempt to bite her.</p>
<p>“Are you human?” she asked the huddled lump at her feet. It did not reply. Hoping that she would not regret the gesture, Jo threw aside the rock and crouched down. </p>
<p>The creature before her appeared to be a young man on the brink of starvation. His forehead felt cool, and he did not have visible bite marks. Jo hoisted his emaciated body over her shoulders and carried him back up the path to the receiving hall.</p>
<p>“We have a visitor.” Jo dumped him on the sofa, causing Clara to jump up with a shriek.</p>
<p>“Did you check for bites?”</p>
<p>“Not thoroughly. Help me, would you?”</p>
<p>They stripped him in silence. He was covered in bruises and lacerations, but he had not been bitten. Clara took a first aid kit down from a shelf and began dabbing at his cuts with hydrogen peroxide, while Jo went into the kitchen to heat up a can of soup. When she returned, one of the man’s eyes was open. The other remained swelled shut.</p>
<p>“Why am I naked?” he asked in a hoarse voice.</p>
<p>“We had to check you for bites,” Clara said apologetically.</p>
<p>“Enjoyed that?” he rasped.</p>
<p>“Not particularly.” Jo passed him the bowl of soup, which he slurped up in seconds. </p>
<p>He put aside the bowl, wiping his mouth. “That’s a hell of a lot better than that smoothie I stole earlier.”</p>
<p>“What smoothie?”</p>
<p>“The one in the glass jar, over in the kitchen. I came in looking for food, but the big one came in before I could open any cabinets.”</p>
<p>For the first time in Clara’s memory, Jo laughed. Hers was a high clear laugh, bell-like. It transformed her pinched, guarded expression into something like a warm invitation. Clara blushed and looked away.</p>
<p>“That was a sourdough starter,” Jo explained, still smiling. “I was angry with Clara because I thought she’d thrown it out.”</p>
<p>“What’s a sourdough starter?”</p>
<p>“Flour cultured with natural yeast.”</p>
<p>He clapped a hand to his mouth in horror. </p>
<p>“I thought it was an almond milk shake!”</p>
<p>Jo started laughing again, and Clara joined in. The visitor grinned sheepishly.</p>
<p>“I guess this isn’t exactly the Lotus Vegan Café.”</p>
<p>“That, it is not.” Clara sat on the floor in front of the sofa. Jo went back into the kitchen and emerged with a loaf of bread and glass of water; she handed the water to the visitor and broke the bread into three chunks, taking one for herself and passing around the other two.</p>
<p>“What’s your story?” she asked.</p>
<p>He ran his hand through his matted hair. “It’ll take a while.”</p>
<p>“Until we’re overrun, we’ve got nothing but time.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>He’d been with a client in a penthouse apartment when the downstairs neighbors banged frantically on their ceiling.</p>
<p>“We’re not being too loud, are we?” he asked, knowing full well that they’d been knocking over furniture since their return from the club at 6 AM. </p>
<p>“It’s fine,” said the client.</p>
<p>Someone knocked at the door.</p>
<p>“My wife’s not supposed to get back until Friday,” the client said, squinting at his watch. </p>
<p>“Who else can it be?”</p>
<p>“It’s Friday.” The client groaned, hauling himself out of bed and pulling on a robe. “I’ll give you a hundred bucks on top of your usual fee if you hide in the closet.”</p>
<p>“Three hundred.”</p>
<p>The knocking continued, steady, insistent. </p>
<p>“Fine. Whatever.” The client ushered him into his closet and closed the door behind him. The closet door was made from a heavy, dark wood, walnut or mahogany, he thought, and impossible to break through if the client locked it from the outside or shoved a chair up under the handle. </p>
<p>His mouth went dry. His throat seized up as his heartbeat sped up so much that sharp pains shot through his chest, knocking the breath out of him with each agonizing blow.</p>
<p>Panic attack, he thought, desperately trying to remember his breathing exercises through a haze of pain. Don’t hyperventilate, three hundred is a lot, three hundred is a textbook and a therapy session if I’m careful.</p>
<p>He was getting himself under control again when he heard an animal snarling outside the closet. For a moment, he worried he would panic again, then realized how ridiculous worrying about panicking was and almost laughed.</p>
<p>Almost, because the snarling was joined by the client’s screams. These ended with a thick, wet ripping noise and the sounds of chewing. </p>
<p>Footsteps approached the closet. </p>
<p>The knocking began again. It was as regular, slow and insistent as the knocking on the bedroom door had been.</p>
<p>His mind went blank.</p>
<p>When he regained consciousness, the knocking had stopped. </p>
<p>He pushed open the closet door. His client lay disemboweled on the floor, dead eyes staring at the ceiling. Bloody footprints marked a trail from his body, to the closet, and back out the bedroom door again.</p>
<p>Human footprints. </p>
<p>Suddenly aware of his thirst, he slammed the bedroom door shut, then dashed into the master bath and stuck his head under the faucet. He drank until his stomach swelled. This dulled his hunger for a few minutes, but it came back with a vengeance.</p>
<p>Hoping that years of subjecting his eardrums to the loudest headphones his clients’ money could buy hadn’t dulled his hearing, he put his ear to the bedroom door and listened. The kitchen was only ten feet away. It seemed quiet outside. Trying not to look at the dead client, he poked around the room in search of a weapon. </p>
<p>His eyes darted to the curtain rod on the far wall. He pushed a chair over to the window, pulling the rod off the two hooks that supported it and pushing the curtain off.</p>
<p>He hefted the rod in his hand. It was made of heavy metal, and would certainly do damage to the animal that ate his client.</p>
<p>He looked out the window and dropped the rod.</p>
<p>Twenty floors below, the roads and sidewalk were clogged with crashed cars. Tiny figures darted between the cars, all running in the same direction.</p>
<p>Farther up the street, a massive crowd of people walked slowly forward. The stopped cars slowed them down – they seemed to have difficulty with going around obstacles. Occasionally, for no reason that he could discern, a small group would break off from the horde and gather around one of the stopped cars; after getting whatever it was they were after, they would rejoin the long, slow march. </p>
<p>He heard a noise from behind. </p>
<p>The client was sitting up.</p>
<p>He picked up the rod and backed up against a wall.</p>
<p>“Hey, I don’t know what’s going on out there but we need to get you to a doctor or something.”</p>
<p>The client opened his mouth, drooling blood. </p>
<p>“You have your… phone, right? We’ll call someone?”</p>
<p>The client began pulling himself across the carpet. </p>
<p>“Please let this be a bad trip,” he said, smashing the decorative pineapple on the end of the curtain rod into his former client’s face. The client stopped moving, but he wasn’t about to wait for him to get up again. He leaped over the body, reached the bedroom door in two bounding steps, opened it and quickly slammed it shut behind him.</p>
<p>The door to the apartment was open. They’d left it like that when they’d gotten back. It didn’t matter; they were in the penthouse, accessible only by keycard, and this building had a security guard. </p>
<p>In the doorway stood what was left of the client’s wife.</p>
<p>She hadn’t been partially eaten, the way he had. Other than the dark blood smeared around her mouth, and the angry red bite marks on her wrist, she looked like any other wealthy socialite of a certain age: slim and refined in a beige linen suit with silk blouse, blonde hair with carefully placed grey streaks wound into a bun at the base of her neck. </p>
<p>Her bloodshot eyes turned to him. She lunged.</p>
<p>She didn’t even bother to dodge the curtain rod. He smashed her head in a few more times for good measure, then kicked the body outside the apartment door. He closed and locked it before turning on the TV to confirm that he was not going crazy.</p>
<p>“I stayed there for a couple months, until the water ran out,” he told Jo and Clara. “The first few days I had the TV telling me what was happening outside, and the month after that the radio was working, but I ran out of batteries. That was after I ran out of food, anyway, and I didn’t care too much about anything except that.”</p>
<p>“How’d you get all the way out here?”</p>
<p>“Client’s motorcycle. The streets were pretty much clear, so I took down his wife again-”</p>
<p>“She got up again?”</p>
<p>“So did he, but they never learned how to work the doorknobs. I got used to the… the knocking.” He scratched his head. “They were in pretty bad shape by the time I left.”</p>
<p>“We burn them,” Jo said. “Burning works.”</p>
<p>“How did you get through the horde?” Clara asked. “Before we lost communication-”</p>
<p>“This morning, actually.”</p>
<p>“People were saying that they’d left the city completely infested,” Clara continued. “No survivors. Hordes of zombies everywhere.”</p>
<p>He shook his head. “I’m sorry. I saw maybe ten, twelve of them? I took the north exit to the highway. Ditched the motorcycle when it ran out of gas. There were a few badly rotted ones in the woods but I walked faster than they could crawl.”</p>
<p>“Did you see anyone else?”</p>
<p>He shook his head again. “You’re the only live people I’ve seen, but I just left the apartment this morning.”</p>
<p>“Where is everyone?” Jo asked.</p>
<p>Neither of her companions answered her. </p>
<p>“And what’s your name, anyway?” she asked the visitor.</p>
<p>“Zeke.”</p>
<p>“Well, Zeke,” Jo said, “Welcome to the sugar shack.”</p>
