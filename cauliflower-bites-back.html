<p>After two weeks of tapping trees, hauling maple water, and boiling it down to syrup in the poorly ventilated, stuffy sugar shack, the maple season was at last coming to an end. Clara usually worked in the maple forest for couple hours at a time, two or three days a week; there were always migrant workers and students ready to take over on the next shift. She and Jo waited for other workers to show up, but nobody came.</p>
<p>Jo offered to help with the tapping, collecting, and boiling, but Clara turned her down. She didn’t want them both to be in the sugar shack, or busy hauling maple water, when zombies overran the perimeter. Instead, Clara struck up a deal: protection in exchange for maple syrup.</p>
<p>Clara spent the warming days boiling down syrup in the sweltering sugar shack or building up the calluses on her hands by hauling water, while Jo patrolled the perimeter of the forest with an iron poker and one of the portable radios they’d found in a supply closet. Cell service was never a given. Sometimes, when Clara could hardly see for the ribbons of sweat streaming into her eyes, she hated Jo for getting to wander around outside while she did all the manual labor. These thoughts were quickly replaced by images of the old lady zombie, and the squelch of her eye jelly as the poker punched through to her brain. </p>
<p>Clara found herself grateful for the arrangement when she considered the alternative.</p>
<p>They had no additional hands for the harvest, but no one was challenging them for possession of the forest, either. Jo had grudgingly agreed to hand over the operation to the owner of the maple forest, should he suddenly appear, but he had a duplex in the heart of downtown and neither he nor any of his family were answering their phones. </p>
<p>Jo dismembered and burned six zombies over the course of three weeks. The trickle of maple water slowed, and Clara began canning the huge buckets of syrup. At night, they curled up on opposite sides of the welcome center’s couch and watched the news broadcasts on the reception hall’s ancient satellite television. </p>
<p>It didn’t surprise Clara, and utterly shocked Jo, when the news networks refused to use the word “zombie” in their initial coverage of the outbreak.</p>
<p>“They’re dead, right?” Jo asked, incredulous. “They’re walking around, and they’re dead. The walking dead. Biting people. Zombies.”</p>
<p>“The exact nature of the disease is unclear, though it appears to be transmittable through bodily fluids,” droned the newscaster, as footage of zombies attacking a field reporter played in the background. “Most infections occur through bites, but we encourage you to boil your drinking water and stay confined to your homes until the all-clear is given. Be warned that any who cross the quarantine line will be-”</p>
<p>“It makes sense,” Clara explained. “Zombies are only real in the movies.”</p>
<p>“Zombies are real in nature! Like that spider that controls the wasp or wasp that controls the spider or whatever.”</p>
<p>“Not everyone has a biology degree.”</p>
<p>“One semester of biology,” Jo corrected. </p>
<p>The electricity flickered periodically, but cell coverage and internet remained intact if the power was on. Clara’s parents hadn’t called again, and whenever she tried to call them she got a “service is disconnected” message. Their social media accounts showed no activity. Clara tried to rationalize this as her parents not having access to electricity. Somehow. Even though the entire internet was buzzing with activity from dozens of quarantine areas, including the one that held Clara’s parents. </p>
<p>FaceBook, Twitter and Instagram were not shy about using the word “zombie.” One of Clara’s few surviving classmates, Sanjay, had been fortunate enough to get himself stranded with six other early-morning shoppers in a supermarket. He’d started a vlog detailing their daily life, showing how they rationed their food supply and maintained the perimeter.</p>
<p>“We’re focusing on the most perishable stuff first,” Sanjay explained, panning the camera across the produce aisle. “Greens, we loaded up on right away. Janice there, the morning stockgirl” – he lurched the camera over to a small, middle-aged woman wearing a stained green smock, who smiled and waved – “Has been helping us blanch and freeze the greens we can’t eat right away using the microwave and freezer room. You wouldn’t believe how much cold storage most groceries have, guys!”</p>
<p>Youtube channels of this variety were popping up every day. Lifestyle blogs, even those maintained by people outside quarantine areas, shifted to a zombie focus.</p>
<p>“The plague hasn’t reached Houston yet, y’all, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t coming our way,” a popular yoga instructor drawled on her channel. “You can’t rely on canned food, because that just ain’t sustainable. I’ll take you guys on a special tour of the Z Garden our neighborhood’s planting – five acres of permaculture, three fence layers and a spike moat.”</p>
<p>Clara and Jo had not planted a garden yet. By mid-June, their food stores had become severely depleted. The racks of flour, fridge full of eggs and shelves full of canned food were showing noticeable gaps. Clara sat down with a pen and paper to make inventory, and concluded that they could survive on strict rations for three months at maximum.</p>
<p>“I think we’re done with maple syrup,” she announced. “We’re going to starve to death this winter if we don’t plant something.”</p>
<p>“If we pour syrup over everything we eat, we can get away with smaller portions.”</p>
<p>“Using up our biggest commodity, and making ourselves sick. This… this post-zombie sugar supplier thing isn’t going to work if we’re dead from overdosing on our own product.”</p>
<p>“Where will we get the seeds?”</p>
<p>Clara shrugged.</p>
<p>“I guess I can take my bike and some syrup cans, see if people around here are willing to trade.”</p>
<p>“There might be food in abandoned houses.”</p>
<p>“And shops. Maybe if I make it to Sanjay’s…”</p>
<p>They stocked Jo’s hiking backpack with syrup cans, water, and maple jerky and inflated her bicycle tires. Jo slung her chain and bike lock across her chest. She tied an old shoe to the part of the chain at her hip to serve as a makeshift holster, and shoved the iron poker into it. Mounting the bike, she waved to Clara as she turned once more to the green belt trail.</p>
<p>Clara blinked back tears as she waved back. Having Jo around meant she was safe. She could move freely through the hall and the forest, knowing that Jo would sound the alarm if she saw an approaching horde. Without her, she could only sit in the root cellar, making as little noise as possible in case the zombies suddenly overran the receiving hall.</p>
<p>She shook herself. Jo wasn’t the only one who had killed zombies. Clara could do the patrols as well. She would need to text Jo if the horde overran the maple forest, assuming cell service was still intact by that time.</p>
<p>Jo biked rapidly along the trail, exulting in a new sense of freedom. For nearly a month, she’d been jogging the same rounds all day, every day, changing only the direction in which she circled the endless forest path through the maple trees. It had gotten so that she welcomed the appearance of a zombie, if only to break up the monotony. </p>
<p>Now she used her newly hardened muscles to propel the bike at breakneck speed, pedaling far away from the maple forest that seemed to press more and more on her each day. Unconsciously, she patted the iron poker. </p>
<p>The first turn-off led to a suburb just south of the one that contained Sanjay’s grocery. Jo dismounted and wheeled her bike slowly down the street, trying to make as little noise as possible. The houses on either side of her were shuttered, silent and dark. If anyone was still alive inside them, they would not be willing to part with their seeds or foodstuffs.</p>
<p>Jo stopped in front of a row of houses with unshuttered windows. One of them still had the lights on. Jo leaned her bike against the porch railing and climbed the stairs.</p>
<p>When she stepped onto the porch, it creaked.</p>
<p>Jo froze, gripping the poker so tightly her knuckles turned white. She counted one, two, three heartbeats as she scanned the area. There was no sign of movement. She advanced to the front door.</p>
<p>It was unlocked. She pushed open the door to reveal a chaos of open luggage cases and children’s toys lying askew. Picking her way over a toppled tricycle, a men’s shaving kit and an open rolling suitcase half-filled with dresses, Jo stepped into the kitchen. </p>
<p>The stench of rotting milk pervaded the room. The congealed bowls of cereal on the table, and the half-full sippy cup resting in the high chair, were the likely culprits. Jo bypassed them and pawed through the cabinets, pulling out anything canned, and any cereal that hadn’t been opened yet. She filled her backpack easily. </p>
<p>The window above the kitchen sink overlooked a small garden. Jo thought that she could see leafy, green carrot tops behind a flower bush, and stepped outside to investigate.</p>
<p>A skeletal hand wrapped around her ankle as soon as she stepped outside. The zombie’s face and throat had been destroyed, probably by the same event that ripped off its entire lower end. The single arm attached to its torso pulled Jo’s leg back with inhuman strength, toward its snapping, lipless mouth.</p>
<p>She wrenched her leg free and took a step back. The creature thrashed wildly. The remnants of its flower-print dress had snagged on a nail underneath the floorboards of the back porch, trapping it next to the door.</p>
<p>The leafy greens were, indeed, carrot tops. The garden was positively bursting with vegetables: unfortunately bolted cauliflower, tender lettuce, bright, vibrant beet and carrot greens poked out from the ground in neat rows, bordered by nasturtiums, marigolds and tomato plants. Jo found a plastic bag filled with seed packets in the garden shed. She placed the packets in the outer pockets of her backpack, then filled the plastic bag with fresh produce. </p>
<p>As she pulled a beet out of the ground, the soil exposed a human foot.</p>
<p>Jo waited for it to start twitching. It did not. </p>
<p>She knelt and began clawing at the garden, exposing first a leg attached to the foot, then a hand – a child’s hand – and a baby’s head, dirt-encrusted, the flesh half-eaten and alive with maggots.</p>
<p>The perfect fertilizer.</p>
<p>Jo didn’t investigate further. She dumped out the abnormally large and colorful garden vegetables and ran past the zombie remnants of the demented gardener, back to her bike, back to Clara and the sugar shack and sanity. </p>
<p>She kept the seeds.</p>
