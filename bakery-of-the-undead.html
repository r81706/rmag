<p>When the zombies burst in, she didn’t panic, and the idea came to her so strongly that she would have called it heaven-sent if she’d believed in that sort of thing. The customers were being torn to pieces but because she wasn’t screaming, the zombies didn’t target her first, and she slipped under the counter and opened the stairway door with a steady hand.</p>
<p>The crunching, ripping and shrieking was barely dulled by the thin floorboards between her feet and the bakery below. Into her hiking backpack she stuffed ten pairs of socks, a water purifier, the jar of roasted peanuts she kept beside her bed and the half-full water bottle thrown carelessly across her running shoes. She hefted the pack and decided that it could take a little more weight: sleeping bag, tarp, her purse (whatever good the money and ID cards in there would do her now) three additional sweaters, two sets of leggings and a ski jacket. </p>
<p>Pulling on her last pair of leggings and her snow pants, she was sweating by the time she zipped her winter coat shut over her t-shirt and sweater. Thick mittens went in one pocket of the winter coat and liner gloves over her hands. She pulled on a ski mask and a wool cap before donning her bike helmet.</p>
<p>Keys in hand, she stepped out onto her balcony. Only one zombie had penetrated to the alley behind the bakery. It snarled, bloody drool glistening in ropes between its blackened teeth. She picked up a grill brush from the barbecue and, newly unwieldy with her heavy pack, walked slowly down the stairs to face the monster.</p>
<p>It lunged toward her. She hoped that her winter coat would hold against the zombie’s teeth. When it bit into her shoulder, she jabbed at its eye socket with the pointy scraper end of the grill brush. It released its grip and dropped to the ground.</p>
<p>Other zombies were figuring out that the only living human was still out back. She heard their snarls as she approached the diseased sapling where she kept her bike chained. The key was in her purse. She unfastened all the straps of the hiking pack and opened the top flap, rooting through it until she found the brown leather strap of her purse, fumbling through receipts until she found the small silver key.</p>
<p>The zombies had figured out how to open the back door. There was no attacking all ten of them with her measly grill brush. She forced her hands to stop shaking and open the bike lock, then sling the chain around her chest. She pulled on the backpack, not bothering to fasten the waist strap this time, and sticking the key in the pocket of her winter coat she hopped on the bike and pedaled for her life.</p>
<p>The streets were a disaster. Zombies feasted on barbecue from flaming car wrecks on either side of the bakery’s entrance. This early in the morning there weren’t too many pedestrians on the sidewalk, and anyone with sense would be holed up in their apartments. She had to swerve a few times to avoid the odd zombie or panicked jogger, but the bakery was only a few blocks from the green belt bike trail and she had a feeling that the outbreak had only just begun – the chaos wasn’t yet in full swing. </p>
<p>Only time I’ve been glad I keep bakers’ hours, she thought, but this wasn’t true and called to mind memories that made a weight of sadness press upon her heart. Kneading dough as the sun rose over the horizon, icing cupcakes in the dim light of the bakery as Rachmaninoff drifted from the radio in lazy gold spirals, folding flaky croissants and watching them blister and brown in the grease-smeared window of the industrial oven. She hadn’t been happy before she’d become a baker, and she knew her old malaise would return if she was forced out of the kitchen.</p>
<p>She’d rather be eaten by a zombie than stop baking. </p>
<p>Disappearing into her thoughts proved to be a near-fatal error. She emerged from her memories to find that the entrails-trailing upper half of a zombie had latched onto her rear wheel, slowing her progress considerably. Its fingers were scraped to the bone by road rash. A few swift kicks, during which the bicycle swayed dangerously, were sufficient to dispatch the zombie.</p>
<p>The rear tire, punctured by hungry rabid nails, whistled.</p>
<p>Once on the green belt trail, she leapt off her bike and wheeled it as fast as she could into the small woods that bordered the path. Patch kits, she’d learned during her two years doing bike deliveries, were a rip-off. You had to carry a couple extra tubes and a bike wrench in your saddlebag.</p>
<p>She detached the rear tire, a process that seemed to take an hour with her sweat-slicked, adrenaline-jittery hands. Screams echoed in the distance but she didn’t think there were zombies nearby, though it would be difficult to make out shuffling footsteps in the underbrush when her own blood was roaring in her ears. Slicing her finger open on a gear shaft, she finally managed to remove the wheel. Shoving a rigid plastic tongue in between the outer wheel cover and the rim, she popped it off and ripped the inner tube from the wheel. She tore open the paper box and plastic bag containing her spare tube open with her teeth and wrapped it around the tire, reattached the wheel cover, then pulled her bike pump out of the other saddlebag and, as carefully as she could, attached the nozzle to the tube’s intake valve.</p>
<p>The sound the pump made – whoosh, whoosh, wheeze – was unbearably loud to her ears. As she pumped furiously, she heard a twig crack behind her.</p>
<p>Please be a raccoon, please be a raccoon</p>
<p>Another twig cracked, and the bushes behind her rustled as if a human-sized weight had carelessly pushed through them. The hairs on the back of her neck stood on end. She forced herself not to turn around, to pump faster.</p>
<p>One, two, three, one, two, three</p>
<p>She continued pumping, waiting until the shuffling steps had come up right behind her, then threw herself backward as hard as she could. The zombie gargled as the full weight of a hundred-fifty-pound baker and her fifty-pound backpack came crashing down on it. She rolled over to find herself face-to-face with a red-eyed, screaming child. Even with both of its lungs punctured, it snapped its neck forward and bit the air millimeters in front of her nose.</p>
<p>She grabbed it by its pigtails and dragged it out of the bushes, to a large rock that marked the entrance to the bike trails, and smashed its skull into the rock until it fell still.</p>
<p>Tears streaming down her cheeks, she finished pumping air into her bike tire and replaced the spent tube, pump and repair kit in her bicycle’s saddlebags. She cinched the backpack’s waist strap tightly, adjusted the arm straps, and mounted her bike.</p>
<p>She’d ridden down the green belt trail often in the days she was already thinking of as Before, capital “B.” In the Before, she’d taken her sleeping bag, water purifier, and a couple loaves of bread from the bakery, often spending the entire weekend meandering through the trails and side-trails, camping out under the stars or, if it started to rain, under her tarp. On these cycling trips, if she ran out of food, she would stop off at the sugar shack reachable by a path that barely counted as a decent trail. The bakery bought their maple syrup and maple sugar from that shack. They knew her well and were always willing to let her refill her water bottle with sweet, cool maple water, and her food stores with maple-marinated deer jerky. </p>
<p>The ride took her two hours. On a normal day, it would take an entire afternoon for her to reach the sugar shack, but she was finding that her legs were capable of far more than she’d ever imagined. </p>
<p>Zombies in sneakers and early-spring workout gear ran at her periodically from bushes or the odd side trail, but they couldn’t keep up. Two wheels beat two half-rotted legs any time. She realized with wry amusement that she could have brought a rolling pin on her journey, and simply whacked aside zombies as they came at her. This would cause her to slow down and have less control over steering, so it was just as well that the idea hadn’t struck her while she was packing. </p>
<p>The familiar brown shed, smoke curling from its chimney, loomed up before her at the end of the trail. She hopped off her bike, jogging it up the dirt path toward the sugar shack.</p>
<p>“It’s Jo!” she yelled, banging on the door.</p>
<p>At first, nothing happened. Then she heard careful, hesitant footsteps. She hoped they were human footsteps. On the other side of the door, someone fumbled with the lock.</p>
<p>The door opened just a crack. Through it, a pair of frightened brown eyes stared out at Jo.</p>
<p>“Come in,” said Clara. She was a few years younger than Jo, and still finishing her degree at the university affiliated with the maple forest and sugar shack. It was through her that Jo had finagled a discount on maple syrup for the bakery. </p>
<p>When Jo stepped inside, Clara closed the door quickly and locked it again.</p>
<p>“I guess you heard.” Jo slumped down against the wall of the sugar shack. The gigantic pots for boiling maple water down into syrup were bubbling merrily away. With Clara stirring the almost-syrup in one of the pots, it could have been a day like any other.</p>
<p>Before.</p>
<p>“I didn’t want to believe it, but I was skyping my girlfriend and she just… someone just… and there was blood everywhere, and all the news channels were talking about some rage virus like in the movies, and now… and now…”</p>
<p>Jo shrugged off her backpack and stood up, putting her arms around Clara. They held each other for a few moments before Clara pulled back.</p>
<p>“Why did you come here?” Clara asked.</p>
<p>“It came to me when I saw the customers being torn apart by the zombies,” Jo explained. She had never been one for mincing words. “I knew that eventually, things would stabilize. The zombies aren’t too hard to fend off so long as you don’t panic. But the whole city’s going to get torn apart in the meantime, and I figured that if I wanted to put myself in a good position I would need a good bargaining tool.”</p>
<p>“Here?” Clara stared at Jo incredulously.</p>
<p>“Of course.” Jo hefted a bucket of newly made maple syrup. “What’s the most valuable substance going to be when all you have left to eat are salty canned vegetables?”</p>
<p>Clara sat down on the thick stump that served as the sugar shack’s only chair. “The city’s overrun with rage zombies, and your first thought is maple syrup?”</p>
<p>Jo grinned. “I am a baker, after all.”</p>
<p>They only had one sleeping bag – Jo’s – between them, so they decided to nap and stand watch in alternating four-hour shifts. Even though it was barely noon, Jo was exhausted from her flight from the city and took the first nap. Clara shook her awake an hour later.</p>
<p>“I hear footsteps,” she said. </p>
<p>Jo sat up.</p>
<p>“Shuffling?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>Peeling herself out of the sleeping bag, Jo tiptoed to the rear window of the sugar shack. Through it she saw only sugar maples, their bare branches damp with early spring rain. </p>
<p>Outside she heard, faintly, the sound of boots squishing through mud.</p>
<p>“It’s on this side of the shack,” she whispered to Clara, putting her hand on the windowless east wall. </p>
<p>The boots stopped. A rhythmic thump, thump, thump started up on the other side of the wall.</p>
<p>“It can’t get in,” Jo said. “Even if it realizes there’s a window, it’ll need a ladder to reach it.”</p>
<p>“How much food do we have?”</p>
<p>Jo reached into her backpack and brought out the half-empty can of roast peanuts.</p>
<p>“With this, the syrup, and the maple water, we can wait it out.”</p>
<p>“They’re not dead, right? Just sick people?”</p>
<p>“I think so.”</p>
<p>“And it doesn’t have water. It’ll die before we do.”</p>
<p>It started shrieking in rage.</p>
<p>In the Before, Jo had dealt with the shrieking of her upstairs neighbor’s colicky baby for hours on end. She had withstood the chain of car alarms set off when some kid knocked a baseball into a windshield. She had been exposed to no shortage of unpleasant sounds, often prolonged, usually without her headphones, which she perpetually lost. </p>
<p>Five minutes of zombie shrieking drove her to throwing open the sugar shack door, grabbing the axe that leant against the wood pile, and smashing in the skull of what had once been a hiker.</p>
<p>She pulled the hiker’s backpack off and relieved him of his boots, windbreaker, track pants and socks before pulling the axe out with a sickening squelch. She wiped the greyish-brown goop off the axe head as best she could in the mud.</p>
<p>She heard boots squishing toward her again, but the sound was in stereo. More than one rage zombie had been turned while hiking in the maple forest that morning, and their compatriot had called them with his shrieks.</p>
<p>Jo readied the axe again. She wasn’t about to let these zombies call for reinforcements.</p>
